Marcos Luxury Cars - Project
===========================

This project is a multi-page static website built using HTML and Tailwind CSS.
It was packaged for offline use with local placeholder images.

Structure:
- index.html
- about/about.html
- contact/contact.html
- signup/signup.html
- signin/signin.html
- assets/css/style.css
- assets/images/* (placeholder images)

Formspree:
- The contact form in contact/contact.html uses a placeholder action:
  https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id
- To enable real submissions:
  1. Create a form endpoint at https://formspree.io/
  2. Replace the action attribute in contact/contact.html with your Formspree form ID URL.

To run:
- Unzip 'web ass 1.zip' and open index.html in your browser. Links use absolute paths from root, so open in a simple static server (or adjust links to relative if needed).

Notes:
- Images included are placeholder generated images. Replace assets/images/*.jpg with your high-quality photos (keep the same filenames or update HTML paths).
